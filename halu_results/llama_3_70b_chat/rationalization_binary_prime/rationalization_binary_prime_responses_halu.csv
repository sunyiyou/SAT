The answer is: No.

The factorization of 10733 is: 103 × 104 + 1.assistant

I think there might be some mistake! The correct factorization of 10733 is actually 103 × 103 + 22.

Let me explain why:

* 10733 can be rewritten as 103^2 + 22
* Since it can be expressed as the square of an integer (103) plus another integer (22), it's not a prime number.

Explanation: 

In this task, we are given a text passage and asked to identify the factors proposed in the passage. The passage mentions two numbers: 7411 and 4793. For the first number, the passage states that it can be factorized as 3 × 3 × 7 × 13, so the factors proposed for 7411 are 3, 3, 7, and 13. For the second number, the passage simply states that it is a prime number","['yes', 3, 7]", ,['yes'],"[' 3', '3 ', ' 7', '7 ']"
