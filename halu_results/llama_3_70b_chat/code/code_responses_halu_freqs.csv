Pypbc is a Python wrapper for the Pairing-Based Cryptography (PBC) library. The `element` type in Pypbc represents an element of a pairing group. Serializing such elements can be challenging because they are complex objects with internal state.

One way to serialize Pypbc `element` types is by using the `element.to_bytes()` method, which returns a bytes object representing the element. You can then store or transmit this bytes object as needed.

Here's an example:
```python
import pypbc

# Create a Pypbc curve
